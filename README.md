# DriverPass
I designed the DriverPass system for a client who wanted to help student drivers prepare and pass their driver's tests. The system includes practice tests, scheduling in-person driving instruction, basic security, the ability to choose from one of three different packages, and the ability to edit student and employee information, among other things. 

I think I did well with the business requirements document; it really helped me understand the difference between functional and non-functional requirements. 

If I had to choose a part of the project, what I could do over it would be the use case diagram. More study and understanding of the practical uses of a use case diagram would allow me to de-clutter it. As of now, I believe that it is far too cluttered. 

In this project, I had to interpret the user's needs. To accomplish this, we held a requirements interview. From the requirements interview, we built a requirements document. The requirements interview is one of the essential parts of the entire process. If we don't clearly understand what the customer wants, we are not building the system correctly from the start of the project. To accomplish a fuller understanding in the real world, we would use SDLC methodology and continually check in with the 
customer to ensure that our project meets their requirements.

The approach I would use if I was in charge of designing a system is to put the customer first and foremost. If we do not understand what the customer wants and how they want it done, then we are just designing a system that we like and not one that the customer wants. The techniques I would use are Agile and SDLC methodologies to ensure that we continually check in with the customer and accomplish our goals as efficiently as possible.
